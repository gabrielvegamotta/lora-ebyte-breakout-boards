# eByte LoRa Breakout Boards
Breakout boards for LoRa modules from eByte.


This project came to be when I was trying/experimenting with LoRa for the first time. But the problem was the pin/pads of the module doesn't have the standart 2.54mm pin spacing for mounting on a breadboard/prefboard. So I created this breakout board to ease the use of this kind of module.
